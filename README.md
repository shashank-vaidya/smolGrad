# smolGrad

smolGrad is a lightweight, from-scratch autograd engine and neural network library written entirely in Python. It implements a simple automatic differentiation system through a custom `Value` class and demonstrates how to build neural network components—such as neurons, layers, and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs)—without relying on heavyweight frameworks. smolGrad is perfect for learning the fundamentals of backpropagation, understanding computation graphs, and experimenting with neural network design in a clear and minimalistic environment.

## Features

- **Automatic Differentiation:** Custom `Value` class to build computation graphs and perform backpropagation.
- **Neural Network Components:** Easily create neurons, layers, and MLPs from scratch.
- **Educational:** A minimal and clear implementation ideal for understanding the inner workings of autograd.
